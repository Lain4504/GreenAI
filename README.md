**Overview**

This project utilizes React.js as the frontend and YOLOv9 as the backend to classify and identify waste. The communication between the frontend and backend is facilitated through APIs. This project is part of a scientific research initiative focusing on the application of AI in waste management.

**Project Structure**

Frontend: The frontend is built using React.js, providing a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system.
Backend: The backend is powered by YOLOv9, an advanced object detection model used for accurately classifying and identifying various types of waste.
API Integration: APIs are used to seamlessly connect the frontend with the backend, enabling the efficient processing and retrieval of data.
